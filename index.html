                <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).[8] The disease was first identified in December of 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic.[9][10] Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.[5] Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.[5][11][12] The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.[5][13] While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.[9][14] As of 14 April 2020, more than 1.94 million[7] cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories,[15] resulting in over 121,000 deaths. More than 465,000 people have recovered.[7]

The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact,[a] often via small droplets produced by coughing,[b] sneezing, or talking.[6][16][18] While these droplets are projected into the air upon exhalation, they usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than being infectious over long distances.[6][19][20] People may also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then their face.[6][16] The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.[21] It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.[22]

The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.[23] Chest CT imaging may also be helpful for diagnosis in individuals where there is a high suspicion of infection based on symptoms and risk factors; however, it is not recommended for routine screening.[24][25]

Recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, maintaining physical distance from others (especially from those with symptoms), covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or inner elbow, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face.[26][27] The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.[28] Recommendations for mask use by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending against their use, some recommending their use, and others requiring their use.[29][30][31] Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.[6] Management involves treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.[32]

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)[33][34] on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020.[10] Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in many countries across all six WHO regions.[35]</p>

            <p>Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.[3][38][39] Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.[3] Less commonly, upper respiratory symptoms—such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat—may be seen. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in varying percentages.[37][40][41] Some cases in China initially presented only with chest tightness and palpitations.[42] In March 2020, reports emerged indicating that loss of the sense of smell (anosmia) may be a common symptom among those with mild cases,[10][36] although not as common as initially reported.[35] In some, the disease may progress to pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death.[7][12] In those who develop severe symptoms, time from symptom onset to needing mechanical ventilation is typically eight days.[43]

As is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment when a person is infected with the virus and the time when they develop symptoms. This is called the incubation period. The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically five to six days but may range from two to 14 days.[44][45] 97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.[46]

Reports indicate that not all who are infected develop symptoms. The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known;[47] however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.[48][49] The proportion of infected people who do not display symptoms is currently unknown and being studied, with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospital stay.[49][50] China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic.[51]</p>
